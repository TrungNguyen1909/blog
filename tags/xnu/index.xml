      <description>Pillow Background This is the writeup for the challenge Pillow, created by Samuel Gro√ü(@saelo) of Project Zero, of 35C3 CTF annually organized by @EatSleepPwnRpt happening at the end of year 2018.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t solve this challenge during the CTF, when revisiting this challenge after checkout @LinusHenze repo, I have a big learning oppuntunity to checkout XNU exploitation, which was completely new to me.
Basic stuff Feel free to skip this part if you have already had a basic knowledge in Mach.</description>

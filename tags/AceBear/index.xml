      <description>House-of-loop Hi everyone, this is the writeup for the challenge House-of-loop in the AceBear Security Contest 2019
Description We are given a stripped ELF x64 binary which can be interacted with, our task is to get remote code execution(RCE).
The binary presents us 3 options: Create, View and Delete a note.

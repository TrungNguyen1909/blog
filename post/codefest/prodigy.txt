The function getFlag is our main objective
Open the binary in gdb, break somewhere in main(preferably entry)
Find the location of getFlag(info functions getFlag (0x080484f0))
set eip = 0x080484f0
break *getFlag+65(ret instruction: where the function will end)
Continue until it reach the breakpoint
Checkout the EAX contains a address to a string
x/s that string and the remaining part next to it (x/2s 0xffffd5f0)
Combine those and you will get the flag
